To whom it may concern:

Pursuant to Open Public Records Act ("OPRA"), I hereby request the following records:

A copy of the most recent collective bargaining agreement/collective agreement(s) between the Hanover Township police department and the local police union/fraternal order/benevolent association, or other similar organization.

As you know, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5.i requires that a custodian of government shall grant access and respond to a request within seven business days of receipt of a request. Therefore, I would appreciate a response as soon as possible and look forward to hearing from you shortly. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If for any reason any portion of my request is denied, as is stated in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5.g, please inform me of specific reason(s) in writing and provide the name and address of the person or body to whom an appeal should be directed.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
