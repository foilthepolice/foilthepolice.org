I request all use of force reports, incident reports and supplemental reports for incidents in which [INSERT YOUR TOWN NAME] police department officers [OFFICER NAME] and [OFFICER NAME] used force during the past 6 years.

I request all notifications, as stated in NJ Attorney General’s Use of Force Policy Section IV, to country prosecutors of instances in which officers used force and someone got hurt during the past 6 years.

As you know, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5.i requires that a custodian of government shall grant access and respond to a request within seven business days of receipt of a request. Therefore, I would appreciate a response as soon as possible and look forward to hearing from you shortly. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If for any reason any portion of my request is denied, as is stated in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5.g, please inform me of specific reason(s) in writing and provide the name and address of the person or body to whom an appeal should be directed.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
